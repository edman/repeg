%A pattern matching tool that evaluates regular expressions using Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs)
A pattern matching tool that evaluates regular expressions to equivalent
Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs) that match the same strings.We implement the
regular expression's semantics using PEGs in a way that saves the user from
learning the PEG syntax, the only knowledge needed is about regular expressions.


A pattern matching tool that evaluate regular expressions by converting them
to equivalent Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs).
The regular expression's semantics is implemented in a way that saves you from
learning any new PEG syntax. That is, writing regular expressions is all you need
to know to start using \libname.

%% Introduction
\section{The \libname{} Library}
\label{sec:introduction}

\libname{} is a library for pattern matching in the Lua programming language.
It uses most of the traditional and well-known PCRL syntax for regular
expressions, therefore it does not incur the acquisition of any new
knowledge by providing a familiar environment. In this text you can find a
reference manual for the library, including its methods and some examples.

%The following table describes the syntax recognized by \libname{} for regular
The table \ref{tab:syntax} describes the syntax \libname{} utilizes for regular
expressions. Here the \markpat{a} or \markpat{b} represent a single character;
\markpat{s} represents a string of characters; \markpat{p} represents a pattern;
and \markpat{num} represents a number (\verb=[0-9]+=).

%% Functions
\section{Functions}
\label{sec:functions}

%%% Function match
\subsection{\markpat{\libname{}.match (pattern, subject)}}
\markpat{pattern} $\rightarrow$ a string describing a regular expression
\\ \markpat{subject} $\rightarrow$ the string of characters to be matched
against the \markpat{pattern}

% match description
Matches directly a \markpat{pattern} to a string, returning the length of
the portion of the \markpat{subject} succesfully matched.


%%% Function find
\subsection{\markpat{\libname{}.find (pattern, subject)}}
\markpat{pattern} $\rightarrow$ a string describing a regular expression
\\ \markpat{subject} $\rightarrow$ the string of characters to be matched
against the \markpat{pattern}

% find description
Seeks for the first substring of the \markpat{subject} that can be matched by
the given \markpat{pattern}. If it matches more than one substring, return the
largest.

%% Usage Examples
\section{Usage Examples}
\label{sec:examples}

%%% A simple program
\subsection{A simple program}
The following code specifies a running Lua program. In this case, both calls for
\markpat{find} and \markpat{match} yeld the same result and could be used
interchangeably.

\begin{verbatim}
RePeg = require 'RePeg'

-- find the first number in a string
string = "this string has 29 characters"
print(RePeg.find("[0-9]+", string)) --> {29}
print(RePeg.match(".*? ([0-9]+)", string)); --> {29}
\end{verbatim}

%%% Matching an image name in html files
\subsection{Matching an image name in html files}
This example matches an image name in html files.

\begin{verbatim}
RePeg = require 'RePeg'

string = [[<html><head>This is an html file</head><body><img src="image_name"></body></html>]]
print(RePeg.find([[<img src=".*"]], string)) -->
\end{verbatim}
