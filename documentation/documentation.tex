A pattern matching tool that translates regular expressions to identical Parsing
Expression Grammars (PEGs). We implement the regular expression's semantics

%% Introduction
\section{The \libname{} Library}
\label{sec:introduction}

\libname{} is a library for pattern matching in the Lua programming language.
It uses most of the traditional and well-known PCRL syntax of regular
expressions, therefore it does not requires the user any new knowledge,
providing a familiar environment. In this text you can find a reference manual
for the library.

%The following table describes the syntax recognized by \libname{} for regular
The table \ref{tab:syntax} describes the syntax recognized by \libname{} for regular
expressions. Here the \markpat{a} or \markpat{b} represent a single character;
\markpat{s} represents a string of characters; \markpat{p} represents a pattern;
\markpat{num} represents a number (\verb=[0-9]+=).

%% Functions
\section{Functions}
\label{sec:functions}

%%% Function match
\subsection{\markpat{\libname{}.match (pattern, subject)}}
\markpat{pattern} $\rightarrow$ a string describing a regular expression
\\ \markpat{subject} $\rightarrow$ the string of characters to be matched
against the \markpat{pattern}

% match description
Matches directly a \markpat{pattern} to a string, returning the portion of the
\markpat{subject} succesfully matched.


%%% Function find
\subsection{\markpat{\libname{}.find (pattern, subject)}}
\markpat{pattern} $\rightarrow$ a string describing a regular expression
\\ \markpat{subject} $\rightarrow$ the string of characters to be matched
against the \markpat{pattern}

% find description
Seeks for the first substring of the \markpat{subject} that can be matched by
the given \markpat{pattern}. If it matches more than one substring, return the
largest.

%% Usage Examples
\section{Usage Examples}
\label{sec:examples}

%%% A simple program
\subsection{A simple program}
The following code specifies a running Lua program. In this case, both calls for
\markpat{find} and \markpat{match} yeld the same result and could be used
interchangeably.

\begin{verbatim}
repeg = require 'repeg'

-- find the first number in a string
string = "this string has 29 characters"
print(repeg.find("[0-9]+", string)) --> {28}
print(repeg.match(".*? ([0-9]+)", string)); --> {28}
\end{verbatim}
